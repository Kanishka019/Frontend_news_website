entertainment, politics, international news etc. Not only holding news, users can see it in
detail and watch video news also. They can comment like and share the post. We will try
to count the rating and user sentiment about the news. The more we will go through this
journey, we will try our best to ensure the best quality on the website.

## Application Features and Description:
### The News Portal Website will have the following features:

## Challenge:
> One of the main challenges of the News Portal Website project will be to ensure
that the content is unbiased and adheres to ethical standards. This will require a team of
experienced journalists and editors who are committed to providing high-quality
journalism. Additionally, generating revenue through advertising and subscriptions may
be a challenge, as there is a lot of competition in the online news market. The website
will need to differentiate itself from other news portals and offer unique value
propositions to attract users and generate revenue.
